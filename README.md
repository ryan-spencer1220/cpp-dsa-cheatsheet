# DSA Study Guide (C++)

## Goals based on Programming Competencies PDF

### Before

#### Students passing CS162 demonstrate fluency at problems such as (for example):

- Adding a node at the end of a linear linked list
- Counting the number of nodes in a linear linked list
- Finding how many times a matching item appears in a linear linked list
- Removing an item from a linear linked list

#### Students passing CS163 demonstrate fluency at problems such as (for example):

- Remove every leaf from a binary search tree
- Return the largest item in a binary search tree
- Calculate the height of a binary search tree
- Finding how many times a matching item appears in a binary search tree

- Students entering CS202 should already be fluent programming in C++ using classes, pointers and dynamic memory (new and delete), functions (using returned values, passing by value and passing by reference), and recursive solutions to pointer based linked data structures.
- Students should be able to demonstrate proficiency at applying recursive solutions to insert, traverse or remove from pointer based linked data structures of:
  - linear linked lists
  - circular linked lists
  - doubly linked lists
  - arrays of linked lists
  - binary search trees.

### Duriing/After

- Show fluency with C++ pointer based data structur solutions.
- At midterm time these include recursive solutions for:
  - linear linked lists
  - circular linked lists
  - doubly linked lists, and arrays of linked lists. At final time these include pointer based data structure solutions for binary search trees; students are expected by this time to be fluent with linux editor functionality (search, replace, navigation) and gdb, implementing recursive solutions for problems similar to these (for example):

1. Linear Linked list: Determine if there are duplicates
2. Circular Linked list: Remove every occurrence of a particular item
3. Doubly Linked list: Swap every other node
4. Array of linked lists: Remove the last item in each linear linked list
5. BST: Return the largest or second largest item in a BST

## Proficiency Exam - General Information

#### Students will be demonstrating proficiency in programming in linux and data structures

1. Every student must show proficiency in a high level programming language such as C++
2. The examination will have student implement various recursive data structure algorithms, using pointer based implementations.
3. All of the coding will be done using linux, with a linux editor (using either vim, or emacs; pico/nano are allowed but not recommended)

#### Every student will also be asked to demonstrate proficiency in using gdb and features of the linux editor that they are using

1. Students will demonstrate navigation
2. Students will demonstrate search and replace
3. Students will demonstrate setting breakpoints in gdb

#### The data structures algorithms implemented may include coding recursive traversal and/or manipulation algorithms for any of the following pointer based data structures:

1. Linear linked lists
2. Doubly linked lists
3. Circular linked lists
4. Binary search trees
5. Arrays of linear linked lists

#### The data in the data structures may be an integer or a dynamically allocated array of characters.

#### Students should be comfortable working within the class construct without the use of an IDE, working with .h file(s) and multiple .cpp files.

#### Students are encouraged to practice prior to the proficiency exam.

## Sample Questions

#### Linear linked lists, circular and doubly linked lists:

1. Write a recursive function in C++ to remove all nodes except for the first and last nodes.
2. Write a recursive function in C++ to remove the last two nodes
3. Write a recursive function in C++ to add a node to the end, if it is unique
4. Write a recursive function in C++ to move the last node to the beginning
5. Write a recursive function in C++ to copy the data structure

#### Binary search trees:

1. Write a recursive function in C++ to make a copy of a binary search tree
2. Write a recursive function in C++ to make a copy of a binary search tree and place it in a
   linear linked list, sorted
3. Write a recursive function in C++ to take a sorted array and insert it into a binary search
   tree balanced
4. Write a recursive function in C++ to add a node into a binary search tree
5. Write a recursive function in C++ to remove the largest item in a binary search tree
6. Write a recursive function in C++ to find the rootâ€™s in-order successor
